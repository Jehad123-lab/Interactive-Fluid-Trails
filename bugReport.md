# Bug Report

## Critical
- (None at this time)

## Warning
- **2024-07-29**: On very high refresh rate monitors, the decay rate might feel too fast. This could be made frame-rate independent by incorporating a `deltaTime` uniform.

## Suggestion
- **2024-07-29**: The trail color is currently hardcoded to white. It would be a nice enhancement to allow theme-based or user-selectable colors.
- **2024-07-29**: Adding touch support for mobile devices would significantly improve accessibility and user experience on those platforms.
